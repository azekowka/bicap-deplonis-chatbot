You will need a Groq API Key to run the application. You can obtain one [here on the Groq console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

To get started locally, you can run the following:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your Groq API key to .env.local, then run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
